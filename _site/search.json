The raw NGSIM data will be preprocessed to cleanup bad data and filter only valid pairs that would help train the model on I-80 and US-101 Highways. The goal is to compare and evaluate the performance of different Models (Random Forest, k Nearest Neighbors, and CNN) and discuss the trajectories along with their R^2 and RMSE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n💠 Problem Statement\r\n\r\n\r\nVery few data driven models predict acceleration accurately.\r\nEven with good RMSE scores, the trajectories do not match or aren’t displayed.\r\nThe papers either falsely claim good acceleration predictions or completely avoid mentioning it.\r\n\r\n💠 Proposed Solution\r\n\r\n\r\nCreate and compare Data Driven car following model using NGSIM dataset.\r\nDisplay and compare trajectories along with R2 and RMSE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n🍴 Prerequisites\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\nThe following open source packages are used in this project: * Numpy * Pandas * TensorFlow * Keras * Matplotlib * Sklearn * pathlib * random * seaborn * pickle * streamlit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n💾 Dataset\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dataset used in this project is called * Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) * and it is publicly available on the U.S. Department of Transportation website. The NGSIM dataset consists of 25 columns and 11.8 million rows of vehicle trajectory data which was captured using a network of synchronized digital video cameras on 4 different locations (US 101, I-80, Peachtree, and Lankershim). The data contains the location of a vehicle at every one-tenth of a second, which gives the exact position of each vehicle relative to other vehicles. A total of 3 different types of vehicle data can be found in this dataset, namely Car, Truck, and Motorcycle. Most of the data were taken from the two freeways i.e., US 101 and I-80, and among the three vehicle types, data on Cars is more as compared to Trucks and Motorcycles. Therefore, we decided to work on only the Freeways. After the Preliminary analysis, we found that some vehicle IDs are present in more than one location meaning that the data from all four locations were taken separately and then merged in a single file. Hence, we separated the data based on location to carry out data cleaning and data transformation and then merge them back.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe NGSIM dataset is publicly available. Please refer to the Link\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n⛙ Roadmap\r\n\r\n\r\nWe trained three models namely k-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, and CNN to predict Acceleration for Subject Vehicle and find rest of the trajectory. The goals of this project include the following:\r\n\r\n\r\nClean and Transform the NGSIM Data\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTrain Random Forest, KNN and CNN on same Train Data.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCompare R2 and RMSE for the models.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nValidate Vehicle Trajectories and compare with R2 and RMSE outcomes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n🔨 Preprocessing\r\n\r\n\r\nThe NGSIM (Next Generation Simulation) dataset includes vehicle trajectory details along with the information of Lead and Following vehicle IDs. Even though the dataset has been processed by the Transportation department there are quite a few instances of Bad Data and vehicle trajectories which wont help in training for a good Car following model. Thus, we have preprocessed the data as per below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n💠 Data-Cleanup\r\n\r\n\r\nBelow are the cleanup tasks that have been performed:\r\nRemove all Vehicles which have bad Vehicle Length and Type. i.e. same vehicle having two vehicle Types in different pair information.\r\nRemove first 5 seconds for a Pair when Lead Vehicle is overtaking. Last 5 from the pair which the vehicle is leaving(same vehicle was Subject in that scneario).\r\nRemove Lane 4 and above as they are shoulders/ramps and exits.\r\nRemove trajectories which are less than 30 seconds.\r\nRemove vehicles with Time headway greater than 10 seconds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n🔶 Data Transformation\r\n\r\n\r\nBelow are the transformation steps that have been followed:\r\nMap Subject and Lead Vehicle information to have them on the same row.\r\nConvert the Feet information to Metric Metres.\r\nConvert the Front - Front Space and Time Headway details to Lead Vehicle Rear Bumper to Subject Vehicle Front Bumper.\r\nCreate per pair timing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n🔍 Results and Discussion\r\n\r\n\r\nThe overall accuracy score of personal and impersonal models are shown in the following tables. Some of the results we observed are similar to the results obtained by Weiss et.al and they are discussed below: \r\n\r\n\r\nRandom Forest with 150 Regressors had the best Trajectory.\r\n\r\nKNN has the best results at hand with limited resources i.e. Local Machine.\r\n\r\n\r\nCNN has best R2 and RMSE but bad trajectories and missed prediction scales.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll three models are able to meet the trajectory oscillations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n🚗 Code\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/VineetDhamija/DataDrivenCarFollowing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n📜 Contributors\r\n\r\n\r\n🎓 All participants in this project are Student of Post Graduate Diploma in Data Analytics for Business @ St Clair College \r\n👦 Vineet Dhamija        Email: VD17@myscc.ca        GitHub: @VineetDhamija \r\n👦 Neel Chaudhari        Email: NC57@myscc.ca        GitHub: @neelschaudhari000 \r\n👦 Rakesh Singh        Email: rs334@myscc.ca        GitHub: @rakesh894 \r\n👦 Umair Durrani        Email: UDURRANI@stclaircollege.ca        GitHub: @durraniu \r\n\r\n ✤ This was the final project for the course DAB402- Capstone (Summer 2022), at St Clair College\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
